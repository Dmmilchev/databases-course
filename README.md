# databases-course
My usual preparation for university courses consists of solving all of the provided problems by the teachers. Sometimes I even solve some
of the problems two or even three times. This repo shows all the work I have done to master SQL query language. In the end, at this part
of the exam I solved all of the problems correctly and I got graded with max points. In addition to the SQL part of the course we had a 
theory part which introduced us to how to create and maintain large databases, good practices, relational algebra and other theory. I gained
valuable knowledge, which I am always willing to extend.
