# Practice
"Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect." - Vince Lombardi

I have a simple schedule of revision. 
I learn something -> I revisit it 2 weeks later. 

In this folder I will commit the tasks I have redone. 
I won't do every problem again, because I don't think that's necessary, 
but I will practice until I have a feeling of proficiency.
